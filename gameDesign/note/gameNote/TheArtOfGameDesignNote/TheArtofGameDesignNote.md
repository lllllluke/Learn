## Hello
**What Is Game Design?**

- Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be.

**Waiting for Mendeleev**

- Mendeleev will never come.
- Game design has no formula.
>*The voyage of discovery is not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes.*
> 	—Marcel Proust

**Focus on Fundamentals**

- Videogames are just a natural growth of traditional games into a new medium.
- Know the principles of simple games is the fundmental of making complex games.

**Talk to Strangers**

- Design is everywhere.

**The Map**

- to truly understand game design is to understand an incredibly complex web of creativity
- bulid your game design map 

**Learning to Think**

- figure out why certain principles don't work in certain cases
- invent new principle of your own
>*Every truth has four corners: as a teacher I give you one corner, and it is for you to find the other three.*
> 	—Confucius

**Why I Hate Books**

- Game design is not a set of principles,it is an activity.
- This book can only give you useful guide and perspectives.
- You can only become a good designer must through practice.
>*I hate books, for they only teach people to talk about what they don’t understand.*
>	—Jean-Jacques Rousseau
>*It is very important to have a balanced approach to study and practice.*
>	—The Dalai Lama

## The Most Important Skill
**Listening**

- with observing and thinking

>*To listen with a silent heart, with a waiting, open soul. Without passion, without desire, without judgment, without rebuke.*
>	—Herman Hesse in *Siddhartha*
## The Five Kinds of Listening
1. Listen to your **team**
   - They share their skills.

2. Listen to your **audience**
   - They decide success or failure of your game.

3. Listen to your **game**

   - know your game inside and out

   - like listening to a engine of a car

4. Listen to your **client**
   - Who is paying you to design the game.

5. Listen to your **Self**

## The Secret of the Gifted

# 2_The Designer Creates an *Experience*
> *I already know the ending / 
> it’s the part that makes your face implode / 
> I don’t know what makes your face implode / 
> but that’s the way the movie ends.*
> 	—They Might Be Giants, *Experimental Film*
> *Of the innumerable effects, or impressions, of which the heart, the intellect, or the soul is susceptible, what one shall I, on the present occasion, select?*
> 	—Edgar Allen Poe, *The Philosophy of Composition
Game designer's goal—**Experience**
- <u>It is this experience that the designer cares about.</u>
- When people play games, they have an experience.
- Without the experience, the game is worthless.

Experience is paradox
- It is too familier to know
- shadowy and nebulous

## The Game Is Not the Experience
![image.png|200](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240127161627.png)

The game enables the experience, but it is not the experience.
- "A tree falls in the forest"the tree makes no sound when no one is there
- Game designers only care about what *seems* to exist.

The imaginary experience is the reason why people play Game.

## Is This Unique to Game?
Compared with other linear experience(books,movies,plays and music)
- Game designers have to cope with much more interaction
- give player a great deal of control over the pacing and sequence of events in the experience(even random events)

Games can generate some certain experience
- choice
- freedom
- responsibility
- accomplishment
- friendship
- and many others

## Three Practical Approaches to Chasing Rainbows
>*There ain’t no rules around here! We’re trying to accomplish something!*
>	—Thomas Edison
Embark on a daunting endeavor
- uncover the mysteries of the human mind 
- uncover the secrets of the human heart

Using approaches brrowed from **psychologists**,**anthropologists** and **designer**
- understand the mechanisms that make people tick
- understand people on a human level
- make people happy

### *1. Psychology*
Early in the twentieth century,a schism in psychology developed.
- **behaviorists**
	- objective
	- focused on measurable behavior
	- more scientific
- **phenomenologists**
	- subjective
	- focused on the nature of human experience
	- “the feeling of what happens.”

Make use of both behavioristic experiments and phenomenological introspection

As a game designer
- ~~what is *defnitely true* in the world of objective reality~~
- <u>what *seems to be true* in the world of subjective experience</u>

### *2. Anthropology*
>Anthropology is the most humanistic of the sciences and the most scientific of the humanities.
>	—Alfred L. Kroeber
more holistic than psychology
- looking at everything about people including their physical, mental, and cultural aspects
- study the similarities and differences between the various peoples

put ourselves in player's place for gaining insights

### *3. Design*
cast a wide net among any other kinds of design
- use principles from different fields of design
- mix and match approaches

## Introspection: Powers,Perils,and Practice
>*A dedicated scientist never hesitates to experiment on himself.*
>	—Fenton Claypool
### *Peril #1: Introspection Can Lead to False Conclusions about Reality*
Most of Aristotle's conclusions reached through deep introspection
- false conclusions about about physics and natural history
- useful conclusions about metaphysics, drama, ethics, and the mind

the trap of building up structures of questionable logic
- feels like it must be true

Game designer primarily cares about what **“feels like it is true.”**
- We care more about how things feel and less about what is really true.

when dealing with the human heart and mind
- introspection is an incredibly powerful and trustworthy tool

### *Peril #2: What Is True of My Experiences May Not Be True for Others*
the problems of "**I only design for people like me**"
- unusual tastes may not lead worthwhile investment  
- different dieas of team members can be hard to resolve
- different kinds of games and audiences will be excluded

the problems of "**personal opinions can't be trusted**"
- You can't leave every decision to playtesting early in the process.
- Before a game finished, playtesters may reject an unusual idea.
- Playtesting can only happen occasionally.

Introspection for game design is a process of not just listening to **yourself** but also listening to **others**.
- trying to put yourself in their place
- make predictions about what experiences they will and will not enjoy

## Dissect Your Feelings
>*Work in the invisible world as least as hard as you do in the visible.*
>	—Rumi
When you play a game
- analyze how it made you feel
- what it made you think of
- what it made you do

The more you analyze your own experiences, the more clearly you will be able to think about the kinds of experiences your games should create.

## Defeating Heisenberg
Heisenberg principle: “paralysis by analysis”

The nature of an experience cannot be observed without disturbing the nature of that experience.

### *Analyze Memories*
Analyze an experience while it is happening can be hard
- not analyze it while you play

<u>Analyze the memory of it immediately after</u>

### *Two Passes*
run through your experience **twice**
- The first time
	- don’t stop to analyze anything
- The second run-through
	- analyzing everything

### *Sneak Glances*
“**sneak quick glances**” at your experience while it is happening
- without thinking about it

### *Observe Silently*
have two minds
- one moving, engaged in an experience
- and one still, silently observing the other

be like the Zen practice of self-observation

## Essential Experience
capture the essence of those experiences for your game
- Every memorable experience has some key features that define it and make it special
- figure out the essential elements that really define the experience

[***Wii Sports***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Sports)

- Designers focused on swinging the controller 
  - to make the baseball experience right


[_**James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_007_(role-playing_game))

- compared with TSR's _**Top Secret**_ 
	- too much like war games
- One mechanic of _**Bond**_ called "**Hero Points**" 
	- replacing rolling dice in the key moment


When you have a clear picture of your ideal experience and its essential elements, your design has something to aspire to.

## All That's Real Is What You Feel
The only reality that we can know is the reality of the experience.
- This illusion is all that can ever be real for us, because it *is* us

# 3_The Experience Takes Place in a *Venue*

## The Shifting Sands of Platform
a system of venues about gameplay

![image.png|200](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202402011358711.png)

## Private Venues
==Gameplay is often aided by privacy==

- immersing
- safe
- most are in the home

### *The Hearth*
the hearth places
- One of the defining aspects of the human species is our relationship with fire.
- a good place for TV or gameplaying

the hearth games 
- <u>entertain multiple people, either by letting them play together or by being fun to watch</u>

	- <u>their minds are in the arena</u>

### *The Museum*
the museum places
- <u>when we look at all sorts of new and exotic objects</u>
	- zoos, aquariums, sightseeing even shopping

## Half Private/Half Public Venues
the flexibility of these spaces that live on the boundary between public and private

### *The Gaming Table*
the gaming table places
- the games that are played around a table
- a special face-to-face intimacy as the players sit like gods over the toy world they control
- in the home when guests are over
- a pool table at a bar or a poker table in a casino

the gaming table games
- Board, card, and dice games

	- tend to have very simple interfaces and stories
	- prefer to be free
	- the peculiarities of their business models

## Venues Mixed and Matched
- while games and technologies change constantly, venues change very little
- the important thing is to see past the games and platforms so that you are aware of the venues and their properties

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202402021611509.png)

# 4_The Experience Rises Out of a *Game*
## A Rant about Definitions
Standardized terms for game definitions will evolve over time
- It is not a matter of knowing the vocabulary of game design
- it is a matter of knowing the ideas of game design

trying to define terms will strengthen your ability to think about design
- Defning things forces you to think about them clearly, concisely, and analytically

## So What Is a Game?
Toy
- A good toy is an object that is fun to play with
	- Fun is pleasure with surprises

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202402221342435.png)

Play
- some too borad or too narrow defnitions
	- *Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy.* 
		  —Friedrich Schiller
		- the outdated “surplus energy” theory
	- *Play refers to those activities which are accompanied by a state of comparative pleasure, exhilaration, power, and the feeling of self-initiative.* 
		  —J. Barnard Gilmore
	- *Play is free movement within a more rigid structure.* 
		  —Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman
	- *Play is whatever is done spontaneously and for its own sake.* 
		  —George Santayana

*Work and play become equivalent to servitude and freedom.*

- The less obligated you are to do something, the more it feels like play

Play is manipulation that indulges curiosity.

## No,Seriously,What Is a Game?
>*Games are an exercise of voluntary control systems, in which there is a contest between powers, confined by rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome.*
>	—Elliot Avedon and Brian Sutton-Smith
1. <u>Games are entered willfully</u>
2. <u>Games have goals</u>
3. <u>Games have conflict</u>
4. <u>Games have rules</u>
5. <u>Games have be won and lost</u>
>*A game is an interactive structure of endogenous meaning that requires players to struggle toward a goal.*
>	—Greg Costikyan
![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202403081059676.png)
6. <u>Games are interactive</u>
7. <u>Games have challenge</u>
8. <u>Games can create their own internal value</u>
>*A game is a closed, formal system, that engages players in structured conflict, and resolves in an unequal outcome.*
>	—Tracy Fullerton, Chris Swain, and Steven Hoffman
9. <u>Games engage players</u>
10. <u>Games are closed,fomal systems</u>

Any game with a goal effectively has presented you with a problem to solve.
- solving problems is one of the things that define us as a species

## Problem Solving 101
"the magic circle"
- our internal problem-solving system

**==A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.==**

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202403081737540.png)

## The Fruits of Our Labor
Defining terms
- Fun is pleasure with surprises.
- Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.
- A toy is an object you play with.
- A good toy is an object that is fun to play with.
- A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.

>*The whole truth regarding play cannot be known until the whole truth regarding life itself is known.*

# 5_the game Consists of *Elements*
## What Are Little Games Made Of?
as a game designer
- need to know what a game is made of 
- need to creat radically new kinds of game

## The Four Basic Elements
![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240309125923.png)

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240309135008.png)

==**Mechanics**==

- <u>These are the procedures and rules of your game</u>
	- different from other linear entertainment experiences
- strengthen that story and let that story emerge
- mechanics will occur in technology
- make players feel like they are in the world that the aesthetics have defined

==**Story**==

- <u>is the sequence of events that unfolds in game</u>
	- linear and prescripted
	- branching and emergent 
- allows your game mechanics to make sense to players
- let your aesthetics emerge at the right pace and have the most impact
- the story will be told through technology

==**Aesthetics**==

- <u>is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels</u>
	- have the most direct relationship to a player’s experience
- emphasize mechanics clearly to players
- reinforce the ideas of your story
- technology is essentially the medium in which the aesthetics take place

==**Technology**==

- <u>not exclusively referring to “high technology”</u>
	- but to any materials and interactions that make your game possible
	- enables game to do certain things and prohibits it from doing other things
- technology that can support mechanics
- be best suited to the particular story
- allow the aesthetics to come through and amplify and reinforce them

**none of the elements are more important than the others**

- each one powerfully influences each of the others
- technology and mechanics are “left brain” elements
- story and aesthetics are “right brain” elements

[Risk Legacy (2011)](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/22/RiskLegacy(2011).html)

- the four basic elements were all working hard toward the same goal
	- to let the player experience the fantasy of battling an alien army

## Skin and Skeleton
skin of a game
- the player’s experience

skeleton of a game
- the elements that make up the game

always consider how the game elements relate to the experience

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240309234350.png)

# 6_The Elements Support a *Theme*
>*To write a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.*
>	—Herman Melville
## Mere Games
The parts of the experience that are important to people all are determined by the design of the game.
- the drama of a sporting event
- the camaraderie between bridge players
- the rivalry of chess enthusiasts

As technology advances, more and more aspects of human life and expression will be integrated into games

## Unifying Themes
The primary benefit of basing your design around a single theme
- since all elements will all be working toward a common goal 
	- elements will reinforce one another

Two step to using a theme to strengthen the power of experience
1. Figure out what your theme is 
2. Use  every means possible to reinforce that theme

What is a theme?
- what your game is about
- the idea that ties your entire game together
	- the idea that all the elements must support

Most game themes are **experience based**
- the goal of the design is to deliver an essential experience to the player

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240311113600.png)

## Resonance
Best themes resonate with players and touch players deeply

the truth-based theme
- The main theme is not experience based. 
- it is a simple statement
	- it is a statement that many of us believe deeply in our heart of hearts

[Risk Legacy (2011)](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/22/RiskLegacy(2011).html)

Resonant themes elevate your work from craft to art.
- An artist is someone who takes you where you could never go alone
- and a theme is the vehicle for getting there

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic/20240311125919.png)

## Back to Reality
Resonant themes can add great power to your work
- but even if your game doesn’t seem to have one, it will still be strengthened by a unifying theme to focus the experience

theme often operates at a subconscious level of plyers

Theme is about focusing your work toward something that holds meaning for your players
- is not about some puzzle-based symbolism where he designer intends a secret message

# 7_The Game Begins with an *Idea*
## Inspiration 
don’t look to other "jugglers" for inspiration—==look everywhere else==
- get tricks from each other can copy moves, but can’t copy inspiration 

![21231231465.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202403121612057.png)

*the emotional heart of art direction*

## State the Problem
Good problem statements tell both your goal and your constraints
- problem will cover four elements

three advantages
- Broader creative space
- Clear measurement
- Better communication

focus on problem instead of solutions

game is a solution to a problem

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/ObsidianPic202403131715134.png)

## How to Sleep
Sleep is crucial to the process of idea generation

Salvador Dali: slumber with a key
- hold heavy a key with your finger
- place a plate upside down on the floor
- just the necessary amount of repose

## Your Silent Partner
>*We are so captivated by and entangled in our subjective consciousness that we have forgotten the age-old fact that God speaks chiefly through dreams and visions.*
>	—Carl Jung
Subconscious
- where most of our ideas come from
- existed before you were born

characteristics of the creative subconscious
- Can’t talk
	- Tends to communicate through imagery and emotions.
- Impulsive
	- Tends not to plan ahead, tends to live in the moment
- Emotional
	- Gets swept up in whatever you are feeling
	- the subconscious feel things more deeply and more powerfully than the conscious mind
- Playful
	- constant curiosity and loves wordplay and pranks
- Irrational
	- Not bound by logic and rationality
	- comes up with ideas that often make no sense
- not for the praise of others but simply for the joy of doing it

Stephen King: treating subconscious mind like a full-time roommate
- regard subconscious mind as another person

### Subconscious Tip #1: Pay Attention
>*“Should we be mindful of dreams?” Joseph asked. “Can we interpret them?” The Master looked into his eyes and said tersely: “We should be mindful of everything, for we can interpret everything.”*
>	—Herman Hesse, *The Glass Bead Game*
pay closer attention to your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions, and your dreams
- for those are the ways the subconscious communicates

### Subconscious Tip #2: Record Your Ideas

>	—John Steinbeck
sleep is primarily for the benefit of the mind
- process of sorting, filing, and reorganizing seems to be going on when we sleep

subconscious is wide awake and active for at least a part of the sleep cycle
- the part that features dreams

### Subconscious Tip #5: Don't Push Too Hard
>*So now you must labor with your brains, and now you must forbear your activity, and see what the great Soul showeth.*
>	—Ralph Waldo Emerson
>*You don’t have ideas – they just let you know when they’re ready.*
>	—Stephen Moffat
Give subconscious a problem to solve and leave it to do its work
- without nagging and looming

brainstorm in categories by elemental tetrad

mix and match the lists

### Brainstorm Tip #15: Talk to Yourself
saying things out loud that makes them more real than just thinking them in your head

### Brainstorm Tip #16: Find a Partner
Groups work best when brainstorming a narrow problem, not a broad, open-ended one
1. brainstorm independently
2. solve problems together

bad brainstorming partners
- poke holes in every idea
- have very narrow tastes

## Look At All These Ideas!Now What?
A game designer must be able to come up with dozens of ideas on any topic

# 8_The Game Improves through *Iteration*
## Choosing an Idea
>*An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all*
>	—Elbert Hubbard
“A plan is a real thing.”
- make snap decisions about your design
- commit to sticking with them
- immediately start thinking about the consequences of the choice
- be ready to reverse your decision when you realize it is wrong
- Just don’t fall in love with your decision

ideas are like cheap paper cups
- when one has holes in it, go get another one

## The Eight Filters
design have to through eight filters

***Filter #1: Artistic impulse**

- Key Question:  <u>“Does this game feel right to you?”</u>

**Filter #2: Demographics**

- Key Question: <u>“Will the intended audience like this game enough?”</u>

**Filter #3: Experience design**

- Key Question: <u>“Is this a well-designed game?”</u>

**Filter #4: Innovation**

- Key Question: <u>“Is this game novel enough?”</u>

**Filter #5: Business and marketing**

- Key Question: <u>“Will this game be profitable?”</u>

**Filter #6: Engineering**

- Key Question: <u>“Is it technically possible to build this game?”</u>

**Filter #7: Social/Community**

- Key Question: <u>“Does this game meet our social and community goals?”</u>

**Filter #8: Playtesting**

- Key Question: <u>“Do the playtesters enjoy the game enough?”</u>

## The Rule of the Loop
The process of game design and development is necessarily iterative, or looping

The Rule of the Loop
- The more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be
- **Loop question 1**: <u>How can I make every loop count?</u>
	- **Spiral model answer**: ==Assess your risks and mitigate them.==
- **Loop question 2**: <u>How can I loop as fast as possible?</u>
	- **Spiral model answer**: ==Build many rough prototypes==

### Example:[Prisoners of Bubbleville: Design Brief](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/23/PrisonersofBubbleville.html)
## Ten Tips for Productive Prototyping
### Prototyping Tip #1: Answer a Question
Every prototype should be designed to answer a question or more
- some sample questions
	- How many animated characters can our technology support in a scene?
	- Is our core gameplay fun? Does it stay fun for a long time?
	- Do our characters and settings fit together well aesthetically
	- How large does a level of this game need to be?

Resist the temptation to overbuild your prototype
- focus only on making it answer the key question

### Prototyping Tip #2: Forget Quality
The faster you build the prototype that answers your question, the better

a polished prototype can actually defeat your purpose by hiding real problems

### Prototyping Tip #3: Don't Get Attached
“*Plan to throw one away—you will anyway.*”
- with the mind-set that prototyping is all temporary 
- as practice for the “real” system

### Prototyping Tip #4: Prioritize Your Prototypes
prioritize prototypes by all the risks that you face

the “upstream” prototype is high priority
- one prototype have the potential to make the other prototypes meaningless

### Prototyping Tip #5: Parallelize Prototypes Productively
work on small, independent prototypes at the same time
- system engineers work on prototypes to answer technology questions
- artists can work on art prototypes
- game scripters can work on gameplay prototypes

### Prototyping Tip #6: It Doesn't Have to Be Digital 
paper prototype
- fast
- capture the same gameplay

#### [Tetris: A Paper Prototype](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/23/Tetris.html)
#### [Halo: A Paper Prototype](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/23/Halo.html)
### Prototyping Tip #7: It Doesn't Have to Be Interactive
Simple sketches and animations can go a long way toward answering questions about gameplay
[Prince of Persia—Sands of Time](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/23/PrinceofPersia-Sands-of-Time.html)

### Prototyping Tip #8: Pick a "Fast Loop" Game Engine
choosing an engine with the right kind of scripting system
- write the low-level stuff that doesn’t need to change much in something fast but static (Assembly, C++, etc.), and write the high-level stuff in something slower but dynamic

### Prototyping Tip #9: Build the Toy first
By building the toy first and then coming up with the game(give the toy a problem to solve)
- You should make sure that your toy is fun to play with before you design a game around it

### Prototyping Tip #10: Seize Opportunities for More Loops
[Halo: A Paper Prototype](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameCopying/2024/08/23/Halo.html)

## Closing the Loop 
The Formal Loop
1. State the problem.
2. Brainstorm some possible solutions.
3. Choose a solution.
4. List the risks of using that solution.
5. Build prototypes to mitigate the risks.
6. Test the prototypes. If they are good enough, stop.
7. State the new problems you are trying to solve, and go to step 2.

## How Much is Enough?
>*…and now I saw, though too late, the folly of beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of our own strength to go through with it.*
>	—Robinson Crusoe
“preproduction” and “production”
- you are in preproduction until you have finished two publishable levels of your game, complete with all necessary features.
- know enough about what your game really is when 30% of the necessary budget has been spent

**50% rule**

- the first
	- if 50% of your budget were removed, you could still have a shippable game
		- keep your systems simple
		- be guaranteed a shippable game.
- the second
	- spend about half the time getting the game working and half the time making it great
		- All core gameplay elements should be fully playable at the halfway mark in your schedule

# 9_The Game Is Made for a *Player*
## Einstein's violin 
Einstein played the violin at a luncheon
- instead of talking about physics

knew his audience
- what audience will and will not like
- there is a big difference between <u>what they think they want</u> and <u>what it is they will actually enjoy</u>

## Project Yourself
use your power of empathy
- put yourself into their place
	- Walt Disney crouched to the ground to imitate a child's perspective

physical and mental perspective
- projecting yourself into the mind of your player
- memory and imagining

## Demographics
>*Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say. It only finds us real children still.*
>	—Goethe
demographics or market segments
- that groups of people are the same
- age and gender 
	- two most significant demographic variables for game designers

![image.png|200](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20240410111304.png)

the younger groups are separated by periods of mental development

he older groups are primarily separated by family transitions

0–3, infant/toddler
- prefer direct interfaces(like a touch screen)
- interested in toys

4–6, preschooler

- generally show their first interest in games
- simple and played with parents games

7–9, kids

- “age of reason.”
	- be able to think and solve problems
	- very interested in gameplaying
- start making their own decisions about what kinds of toys and games they like and dislike
	- no longer just accepting whatever their parents choose for them.

10–13, preteen or “tween”

- “age of obsession,”
- get quite passionate about their interests

13–18, teen

- a significant divergence between male and female interests
	- Boys interested in competition and mastery
	- Girls more focused on real-world issues and communication
- both interested in experimenting with new kinds of experiences

18–24, young adult

- the first “adult”
- established certain tastes about the kind of play and entertainment they enjoy

25–35, twenties and thirties

- “peak family formation.”
- casual gameplayers
	- most adults in this age bracket
	- playing games as an occasional amusement
	- playing games with their young children
- hardcore gamers
	- an important target market
	- often quite vocal about games
		- potentially influencing the buying decisions of their social network

35–50, thirties and forties

- “family maturation”
	- are very caught up in career and family responsibilities and are only casual gameplayers
- look for gameplaying opportunities the whole family can enjoy together(though expensive game purchases)

50+, fifties and up

- “empty nesters,”
	- facing retirement
	- have a lot of time on their hands
- interested in game experiences that have a strong social component
	- golf, tennis, bridge, and online multiplayer games
	- successful Facebook games(WeChat games?)
	- tiny screens or complex fine motor control can be frustrating

all play activities are connected to childhood, since childhood is centered around play
- to truly communicate with someone, you must speak the language of their childhood

## The Medium Is the Misogynit?
the core of playing games is mastering abstract formal systems
- it does not mean that finding and mastering these systems is the only experience 

realize that there are some important differences between genders
- consider whether your game has the right features to delight the audience you are designing for

### Five Thing Males Like to See in Games
>*If you are a woman and you don’t understand men, chances are you are thinking too hard.*
>	—Louis Ramey
Mastery
- Males enjoy mastering things
	- it only has to be challenging
	- though it doesn’t have to be something important or useful
- Females tend to be more interested in mastery when it has a meaningful purpose.

Competition
- Males really enjoy competing against others
	- prove that they are the best
- for females 
	- the bad feelings often outweigh the positive feelings of winning

Destruction
- young boys knock down the tower of blocks once it is built
	- the most exciting part
- game allow for virtual destruction of a magnitude far greater than would be possible in the real world.

Spatial puzzles
- involve navigating 3D spaces are often quite intriguing to males
	-  sometimes frustrating for females.
- males generally have stronger skills of spatial reasoning than females

Trial and error
- Males tend to have a preference for learning things through trial and error

### Five Things Females Like to See in Games
>Females want experiences where they can make emotional and social discoveries that they can apply to their own lives.
>	—Heidi Dangelmeier
Emotion
- romance novels are purchased almost by women
- For males, emotion is an interesting component of an experience but seldom an end in itself

Real world
- Females tend to prefer entertainment that connects meaningfully to the real world
- The massive influx of female players to online social games seems to have less to do with the games and much more to do with the centrality of the friends’ list as a game feature.

Nurturing
- Females enjoy nurturing
- The success of farming games and pet games with girls and women is due in large part to their nurturing mechanics.
- a “healing” game mechanic 
	- Girls enjoy helping a weaker player

Dialog and verbal puzzles
- what females lack in spatial skills they make up for in increased verbal skills
- the audience for crossword puzzles is mostly female

Learning by example
- They have a strong appreciation for clear tutorials that lead you carefully
	- step-by-step
	[[The Hasbro#The Hasbro's game designed for which gender]] 

The introduction of affordable computers gave us a type of game that
- Had all social aspects removed
- Had most verbal and emotional aspects removed
- Was largely divorced from the real world
- Was generally hard to learn
- And offered the possibility for unlimited virtual destruction

As digital technology has evolved to the point that
- videogames can now support emotional character portrayals, richer stories, and the opportunity to play with real friends at convenient times, the female audience for videogames has been commensurately growing.

![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20240410161134.png)

[Disney Quest](https://lllllluke.github.io/gameDesignNote/2024/08/23/DisneyQuest.html)

- By paying close attention to the desires and behaviors of our various target demographics, we were able to balance the game to suit all of them.

## Psychographics
after group people by these external factors
- trying to get at something internal: what each group finds pleasurable

### LeBlanc's Taxonomy of Game Pleasures
Sensation
- Sensory pleasure make a good game into a better one
	- but cannot make a bad game into a good one

Fantasy
- This is the pleasure of the imaginary world and the pleasure of imagining yourself as something that you are not

Narrative
- a dramatic unfolding of a sequence of events
	- not only  the telling of a prescribed, linear story

Challenge
- one of the core pleasures 
- every game, at its heart, has a problem to be solved

Fellowship
- everything enjoyable about friendship, cooperation, and community

Discovery
- any time you seek and find something new, that is a discovery

Expression
- expressing yourself and creating things

Submission
- leaving the real world behind and entering into a new, more enjoyable, set of rules and meaning

### Bartle's Taxonomy of Player Types
![image.png|400](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20240411164340.png)

♦ Achievers
- want to achieve the goals of the game
	- interested in acting on the world
- Their primary pleasure is challenge

♠ Explorers
- want to get to know the breadth of the game
	- interested in interacting with the world
- Their primary pleasure is discovery

♥ Socializers
- are interested in relationships with other people
	- interested in interacting with players
- They primarily seek the pleasures of fellowship

♣ Killers
- are interested in competing with and defeating others
	- interested in acting on players
- “imposing themselves on others”
	- enjoy a mix of the pleasures of competition and destruction
	- includes people who are primarily interested in helping others

### More Pleasure: MORE!
Anticipation
- When you know a pleasure is coming, just waiting for it is a kind of pleasure

Completion
- It feels good to finish something

Delight in another’s misfortune
- when some unjust person suddenly gets their comeuppance

Gift giving
- make someone else happy through the surprise of a gift

Humor
- Two unconnected things are suddenly united by a paradigm shift

Possibility
- have many choices and you know could pick any one of them

Pride in an accomplishment
- This is a pleasure all its own that can persist long after the accomplishment was made

Surprise
- brain likes surprises

Thrill
- roller coaster designers:“fear minus death equals fun.”

Triumph over adversity
- accomplish something that you knew was a long shot

Wonder

- An overwhelming feeling of awe and amazement

# 10_The Experience Is in the _Player's Mind_ 
Now we must consider the interaction of the conscious and subconscious in the mind of the player.

## Modeling 
Reality is amazingly complex. The only way our minds are able to get by at all is by simplifying reality so that we can make some sense of it.
- Correspondingly, our minds do not deal with reality itself, but instead with models of reality.
- Consciousness is an illusion that our internal experiences are reality, when in truth they are imperfect simulations of something we may never truly understand.

![image.png|200](https://997523841-1323914366.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/20240426162737.png)

Charlie Brown seems like a person even though he doesn’t look like anyone we know because he matches some of our internal models.

When we are presented with a picture already drawn with lines, it has been “predigested” in a sense, matching our internal modeling mechanisms perfectly and saving them a lot of work.

Our brains do a tremendous amount of work to boil down the complexity of reality into simpler mental models that can be easily stored, considered, and manipulated.

As game designers, we care a lot about these mental models because games, with their simple rules, are like Charlie Brown—they are predigested models that we can easily absorb and manipulate.

Reality is beyond our understanding and comprehension. All we can understand is our little model of reality. Sometimes this model breaks, and we have to fix it. The reality we experience is just an illusion, but this illusion is the only reality we will ever know.
- As a designer, if you can understand and control how that illusion is formed in your player’s mind, you will create experiences that feel as real, or more real, than reality itself.

## Focus
> *Time sometimes flies like a bird, sometimes crawls like a snail; but a man is happiest when he does not even notice whether it passes swiftly of slowly.*
> —Ivan Turgenev

Flow is something defined as "a feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity, with a high level of enjoyment and fulfillment." 

Some of the key components necessary to create an activity that puts a player into a flow state.
- **Clear goals**
- **No distractions** 
- **Direct feedback**
- **Continuously challenging**
